The main cost of collision test is at function named "GetCollisionTime" which almost cost 76.79% time.
And In this function, GetBorderLines() and GetBorderPoints() cost almost 35% time, and it is because of the lack structure to represent the border lines and border points, I will update this structure latter. 
Besides, I found the bottlenect were how you detect the collsion, not the exact calculation like Matrix Multiplication.
And I could use heap to store the existing results avoiding redundant calculation.
